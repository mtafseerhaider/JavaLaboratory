- What is the difference between GUI and CLI?
  GUI allows the user to interact with the system using graphical elements such as windows, icons, menus
  while the Command Line Interface (CLI) allows the user to interact with the system using commands.

- What is a shell in terms of a CLI?
  CLIs that interface with the operating system are called shells.
  Shells for Windows are PowerShell, CMD and DOS.
  Bash is the modern shell using by Git Bash.

- What is the command to change the directory? | cd [directoryName]
- What is the command to navigate to home directory? | cd ~
- What is the command to show the current working directory? | pwd
- What is the command to display the name of files and subdirectories in a directory? | ls

- What is Git?
  Git is a decentralized and distributed version control system.
- What is a repository in Git?
  A directory or storage space where your projects can live. Sometimes GitHub users shorten this to “repo.”
  It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub or another online host.
  You can keep code files, text files, image files, you name it, inside a repository.
- What are the three stages of Git?
  Working directory, Staging area, Commit stage (Git repository)
  Files in a repository go through three stages before being under version control with git:
  1. Untracked: the file exists, but is not part of git's version control
  2. Staged: the file has been added to git's version control but changes have not been committed
  3. Committed: the change has been committed
- What is a remote repository?
  The repository on Github storage space.
- What is master branch?
  In Git, "master" is a naming convention for a branch. After cloning (downloading) a project from a remote server,
  the resulting local repository has a single local branch: the so-called "master" branch. This means that "master"
  can be seen as a repository's "default" branch.
- What is the command to add a file to git staging area? | git add [filename]
- What is the command to add the file to .git folder? | git commit -m "message"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 Untracked Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- These are the files that exists in your project locally but are not part of the git’s version control.

- This these are files in stage 1 of git workflow i.e. working directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  Tracked Files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A tracked file is any file that Git is aware of and tracking actively.

- That would be any file that has already been committed into the Git repository, or any file that has been
  added to the Git index, or the Git staging area.

- So, a way to find out if your file is being tracked by Git, is to use the "git ls-files" command.

                                                  Git Push
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.

- Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

- Command: git push <remote> <branch>

- git push is most commonly used to publish an upload local changes to a central repository.

- After a local repository has been modified a push is executed to share the modifications with remote team members.

                                                  Git Pull
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately
  update the local repository to match that content.

- Command: git pull <remote> <branch>

- The git pull command is actually a combination of two other commands, git fetch followed by git merge.
  In the first stage of operation git pull will execute a git fetch scoped to the local branch that HEAD
  is pointed at.

- The HEAD points out the last commit in the current checkout branch. It is like a pointer to any reference.
  The HEAD can be understood as the "current branch." When you switch branches with 'checkout,' the HEAD is
  transferred to the new branch.

- Once the content is downloaded, git pull will enter a merge workflow. A new merge commit will be created
  and HEAD updated to point at the new commit.
