A program, also known as software, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
Before you start coding always think through the design of what it is that you're coding.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a problem, you can solve that problem using an algorithm, which is a high-level step-by-step
guide to complete a task. Generally, it involves 5 steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Declare known values & unknown values
Step 2 - Initialize known values
Step 3 - Get values for the unknown
Step 4 – Implement your code logic
Step 5 – Output the program

                                               Topics: Overloading
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a class Month and within this class create two methods that are called getMonth with below signatures:
1. One of the methods takes an integer for the month and then return the String value of that month.
2. Another method should have an overloaded method that will take the String version of the month and return
   the integer.
Create another class called MonthConverter and call these methods to print the current month on the console.
The output of your program should be:

Current Month Name is: July
Current Month Number is: 7

Create two classes Rectangle and Square. Write a method calculatePerimeter when length of rectangle is 8 and
width is 10 in the Rectangle class. You Square class should extend the Rectangle class and override the
calculatePerimeter method. Finally, create a PerimeterTester class to call these methods and print the
perimeters on the console. The output of your program should be:

Perimeter of Rectangle: 36.0
Perimeter of Square: 32.0

                                               Topics: Overriding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a class called Fruit. This class should contain a field called calories and a method called makeJuice(),
which prints a statement — something like “juice is made” - just something generic.
Then create two subclasses of the Fruit class. For example, you can do Apple and Banana, or Orange and Lemon,
whatever you would like to do. And then create methods within these classes that are specific to them.
So, if you're going to do the Apple class, then do something like removeSeeds(). If you're going to do the Banana
class, then do something like peel(). And then set the calories within the constructors of these subclasses.
Override the makeJuice() method to print the specific type of juice that's going to be made.
And then finally create a Market class which tests polymorphism by creating several variations of these objects.
The output of your program should be:

Apple seeds removed
Apple seeds removed
Banana has been peeled
Banana has been peeled
Squeezing...Apple juice is my favorite ?
Squeezing...Banana juice is gross ?
Squeezing...Banana juice is gross ?
Squeezing...Juice is made
