A program, also known as software, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
Before you start coding always think through the design of what it is that you're coding. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a problem, you can solve that problem using an algorithm, which is a high-level step-by-step 
guide to complete a task. Generally, it involves 5 steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Declare known values & unknown values
Step 2 - Initialize known values
Step 3 - Get values for the unknown
Step 4 – Implement your code logic
Step 5 – Output the program

                                               Practice Program 1
                          Topics: String Concatenation, Concatenation Operator, Scanner class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program to take your first name, middle name, and last name as user inputs. Concatenate your names to 
print your full name on the console.
The sample input and output of your program should be:

Enter your firstname >>>John
Enter your middle name >>>Vilde
Enter your lastname >>>Martin
My full name is: John Vilde Martin

                                               Practice Program 2
                                              Topics: Scanner class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program to calculate an employee’s gross pay. Take pay rate and work hours from user input.
The sample input and output of your program should be:

Enter the number of hours you worked. >>>40
Enter your pay rate. >>>30
Your gross pay is: $1200.0

*Hint: Gross pay = hours worked * hourly rate

                                               Practice Program 3
                                        Topics: If statement, Scanner class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All salespeople get a payment of $700 a week. Salespeople who exceed 10 sales get an additional bonus of $300. 
Write a program which extra sales as input from the user and calculate the employee’s total salary in a week.
The sample input and output of your program should be:

How many sales did the employee make this week?
12
The employee's pay is $1000.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Practice Program 4
                                      Topics: If-Else statement, Scanner class
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All salespeople are expected to make at least 10 sales each week. Write a program to calculate quota of the 
employees and for those who made 10 sales each week, print a congratulatory message. For those who don't, print 
how many sales they were short.
The sample input and output of your program should be:

Enter the number of sales you made this week:
9
You did not make your quota. You were 1 sales short

*Hint: salesShort = quota - sales
