                                          Intro to Java & Java components
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Java was designed by James Gosling while he was working at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. 
  The project was initially called 'Oak' before a highly caffeinated brainstorming session produced 
  the name 'Java' (although they very nearly went with 'Silk'). Java, or Jawa in Indonesian, is the 
  name of a large island in Indonesia that produces strong, dark and sweet coffee. It has been a slang 
  term for coffee in the United States since the 1800s.
  
 - Java platform is a collection of software components which allow development and execution of 
   bytecode based languages.
   
 - Bytecode is binary code that Java platform interpret. The Java platform is composed of
		1. Compiler – It generate bytecode from source code
		2. Java Virtual Machine – It provide runtime execution environment for bytecode.
		3. Libraries – It contain Java API.
		4. Tools – Various Java Tools.   
		
- The Java bytecode has two important characteristics
		1. It is processor independent i.e. the program can run on any processor architecture.
		2. It is Operating System independent i.e. bytecode does not target any Operating
		   System such as Windows or Linux.	
		   
- The Java platform is available in four flavors based upon device type.
		1. Java Card – It is used in smart cards and small memory devices.
		2. Java ME (Micro Edition) – It is used in Personnel Digital Assistants, Setup Box and
		   printers application.
		3. Java SE (Standard Edition) – It is used in development of desktop, communication
		   and User Interface based applications.
		4. Java EE (Enterprise Edition) – It is used in development of web based, messaging,
		   distributed and enterprise applications.	
		   
- Some of the important attributes of Java Language are:
		1. Statically typed – The type of the variable is known at compile time.
		2. Object oriented – Object centered programming.
		3. Concurrent – Support for multi-threading programming.
		4. Reflective – Allows inspection of class, method, interface, fields.	

- The minimum environment required for a java program to run is called JRE (Java Runtime Engine).
  
- JDK is the minimum environment required for development of Java Applications.

- Compiler (Javac.exe) is used to compile java code to bytecode. The compilation process generate
  bytecode. Bytecode is binary code that is understood by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- Interpreter (java.exe) is used to process bytecode to native code. It is used for executing Java 
  programs i.e. the interpreter take bytecode as an input and execute that code by converting it to 
  native code.

                                          First Java Programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
- A class represents a single concept.

- A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

- In Java, every application must contain a main() method, which is the entry point for the application. 
  All other methods are invoked from the main() method.
  
- The signature of the main method is public static void main(String[] args) { } . It accepts a single 
  argument: an array of elements of type String.
  
- System.out.println() can print to the console:
    - System is a class from the core library provided by Java
    - out is an object that controls the output
    - println() is a method associated with that object that receives a single argument  
    
- Java has three kinds of comments:
		1. Single-line: // this is single line comment
		2. Multi-line comment: /* this is multi line comments */
		3. JavaDoc comments: /** JavaDoc comments */.

- In Java, when we compile a program, each individual class is converted into a .class file, which is 
  known as byte code.

- In Java, a statement is a line of code that executes a task and is terminated with a ; . 

- In Java, literals are used to indicate simple values in your Java programs.

                                           Variables & Data Types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A variable is a location in memory (storage area) to hold data. To indicate the storage area, each 
  variable should be given a unique name (identifier).

- Variables have a name, a type, and a value. Before you can use a variable, you have to declare it. 
  After it is declared, you can then assign values to it.
  
- Java actually has three kinds of variables: instance variables, class variables, and local variables.  

- Java’s most basic data types are known as primitive data types and are in the system by default.
  The available types are as follows: int, char, boolean, byte, short, long, float, double, null

- In Java, the int datatype is used to store integer values. This means that it can store all positive 
  and negative whole numbers and zero.
  
- In Java, the boolean primitive data type is used to store a value, which can be either true or false .  

- In Java, char is used to store a single character. The character must be enclosed in single quotes.

- A String in Java is a Object that holds multiple characters. It is not a primitive datatype.

- A String can be created by placing characters between a pair of double quotes ( " ).

- To compare Strings, the equals() method must be used instead of the primitive equality comparator == .
