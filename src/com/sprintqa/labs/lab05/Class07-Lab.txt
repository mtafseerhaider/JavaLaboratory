                                                Important
A program, also known as software, is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task.
Before you start coding always think through the design of what it is that you're coding. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Given a problem, you can solve that problem using an algorithm, which is a high-level step-by-step 
guide to complete a task. Generally, it involves 5 steps:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - Declare known values & unknown values
Step 2 - Initialize known values
Step 3 - Get values for the unknown
Step 4 – Implement your code logic
Step 5 – Output the program

                                               Practice Program 1
                                     Topics: Increment/ Decrement Operators
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declare two variables x and y. Initialize x with 10. Add 10 and post-incremented x to y. Print the values of x
and y before and after post-increment. Now Initialize x with 15. Add 15 and pre-incremented x to y. Print the 
values of x and y before and after pre-increment. Add 10 and post-decremented x to y. Print the values of x
and y before and after post-decrement. Lastly, add 10 and pre-decremented x to y. Print the values of x
and y before and after pre-decrement. 
The output of your program should be:

Before x++ : Value of x = 10
Value of y = 20
After x++ : Value of x = 11
Before ++x : Value of x = 15
Value of y = 31
After ++x : Value of x = 16
Before x-- : Value of x = 16
Value of y = 26
After x-- : Value of x = 15
Before --x: Value of x = 15
Value of y = 24
After --x : Value of x = 14

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program to find the sum of first 100 natural numbers. The output of your program should be:

Sum of 1st 100 natural numbers is: 5050

                                               Topics: While Loop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program that asks the user to input an integer and prints it until user enter 0 (zero).
The sample input and output of your program should be:

Enter your number:
5
You entered: 5
Enter your number:
0
You are out of loop because you entered: 0

                                               Topics: While Loop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each store employee makes $15 an hour. Maximum hours allowed are 40. Write a program that allows the employee
to enter the number of hours worked for the week and calculate its gross pay. Do not allow overtime and if 
user enters more than 40 hours then ask the user to try again. You program must not close when you ask user
to try again. The sample input and output of your program should be:

How many hours did you work this week?
41
Invalid entry. Your hours must be between 1 and 40. Try again.
40
Your gross pay: $600.0

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a program to print the multiplication table 1-10 of a number entered by user using a while loop.
The sample input and output of your program should be:

Enter your number to print its multiplication table:
5
5*1 = 5
5*2 = 10
5*3 = 15
5*4 = 20
5*5 = 25
5*6 = 30
5*7 = 35
5*8 = 40
5*9 = 45
5*10 = 50
